My name is Madison Peterson-Porta. I currently am a sophomore attending Lehigh University. I'm majoring in International Relations and minoring in Journalism. I write for the Brown and White in my spare time and was previously the assistant sports editor of the paper. I'm originally from River Edge, New Jersey and attended high school at the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut.
